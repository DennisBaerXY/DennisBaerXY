# Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Dennis.

I am a Computer Science student in Germany and I have a passion for programming. I love working on new projects and I also enjoy playing sports and spending time with friends and family.

At the moment, I focus on fullstack development because I find it the most enjoyable aspect of programming. I have used technologies like Next.JS, Node.JS, React and many more. My main programming language is TypeScript and Kotlin. 

However, fullstack development with a NodeJS backend is my preference and I am confident using SQL or NoSql databases.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use AWS and Docker.
